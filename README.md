# Saccadox
In this, the Master and Slave codes for the Saccadox are provided, with some variations in it's functionality.
1. Random button glowing (Without delay)
   In this the random push button glows and when it is pressed then only the another random push button will glow and the count is incremented.
   Master code :- Random_Without_Delay_Master
   Slave code :- Random_Without_Delay_Slave
2. Random button glowing (With delay)
   In this the random push button glows and it switches to another push button with the time delay of 1500 miliseconds even if the button is not pressed. Only those 
   button pressed are counted which are done which that button is glowing.
   Master code :- Random_With_Delay_Master
   Slave code :- Random_With_Delay_Slave
3. Circular button glowing (Without delay)
   This variation works similar as Random button glowing without delay only difference is that the push buttons glows in clockwise direction in circular manner 
   starting from inside circle to outer circle.
   Master code :- Circular_Without_Delay_Master
   Slave code :- Circular_Without_Delay_Slave
4. Circular button glowing (With Delay)
   This works in same fashion that of random button glowing with delay the only difference is in which sequence the buttons are glowing. In this they glows in 
   clockwise circular direction from inner circle first then the outer one.
   Master code :- Circular_With_Delay_Master
   Slave code :- Circular_With_Delay_Slave
